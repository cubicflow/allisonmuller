I frequently get calls from attorneys who have a case that involves medications (usually prescription but let's not forget herbals and over-the-counter too). Could a medication (or a few medications) have been responsible for a patient's symptoms or clinical course? That is always a complicated question and requires more than just a simple list of medications that the patient takes to answer. So what detective work can an attorney do? There are some questions that attorneys can answer for themselves [with this checklist](/handout 1 checklist for medication misadventures muller.pdf) and also some answers they can provide to their toxicology consultant before deciding on the viability of a case.
