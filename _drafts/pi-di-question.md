I recently gave a continuing legal education talk entitled "Medication Misadventures: 10 Tips for Attorneys". The goal of the session was to provide tips to attorneys on how they can evaluate cases where a medication may have caused harm to a patient. Part of the presentation included a review of [sources I recommend to attorneys for reliable and free drug information](/handout 2 drug info sources for medication misadventures muller.pdf). The topic of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information came up and I discussed what it is useful for and what it is not. Thank you to two guest bloggers, Anshika Singh and Jabin Mathew, two Doctor of Pharmacy students (class of '17) from Jefferson School of Pharmacy, for addressing the specific question of "how useful is prescribing information for toxicology-related information?". &nbsp;
