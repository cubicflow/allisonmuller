I often get asked by attorneys to review cases that involve the living. But at times, cases involve the dead and the question becomes: what happened before death? Specifically, what was the role, if any, of the drugs/chemicals/toxins found in the decedents body when postmortem toxicology testing was done? Cases include those involving death following drug delivery, medication-related deaths, accidents following drug or alcohol use (motor vehicle or workplace),&nbsp;

When it comes to drugs, it's not easy (and at times, not possible) to know what amount of drug was used prior to death. In my CLE talk "Postmortem Toxicology for Attorneys: What Dead People Can Tell Us?", one of my main take-home points is that if all you have are postmortem drug levels, then all you have are postmortem drug levels. I know, that sounds profound. But, it is. The reason is that there are published tables of postmortem blood concentrations for numerous drugs out there and available. The issue with them is they have created the expectation that a toxicologist can simply look up these tables, compare them with a postmortem toxicology report, and voila! … determine if the drug was taken antemortem (before death) in a therapeutic, toxic, or fatal dose. Those tables have their time and place. They are not meant to be used in isolation but rather simply as a starting point of a toxicologic investigation. "User beware".

The number of variables that can influence postmortem drug levels are too numerous to take a number and look it up on a table (although yes, I've seen this done - and have disagreed with conclusions). As a toxicologist interpreting postmortem drug levels, I want to hear a "story". This story should include as many of these chapters as possible: the decedent's medical history (eg, medical conditions, medication history, drug abuse history), information from the scene (eg, drugs, drug paraphernalia), witness accounts (what was the decedent's behavior prior to death?), autopsy findings, when the postmortem samples were collected, the location from which the postmortem samples were collected, and the circumstances of death. There of course can be other chapters to this story (these are just a few).
