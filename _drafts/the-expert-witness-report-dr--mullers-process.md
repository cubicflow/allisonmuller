Everyone does an expert witness report a little differently. I briefly describe my approach to such reports in this short video...the when, how, and why I write these reports as a toxicologist opining on legal cases. The take-home message is "know your audience". As much as I love to teach and discuss toxicology, attorneys (and juries) don't speak the same scientific-language, and it's unlikely they want to read a mini-textbook to understand my methodology and opinion.&nbsp;
