Dr. Emma Hitt Nichols, CEO of Nascent Medical, has compiled interviews with medical writers about their careers, current work, and their specialties. She is a great interviewer, experienced medical writer, and savvy small businesswoman! I enjoyed doing an [interview](http://medicalwritersspeak.libsyn.com/podcast/allison-muller-pharmd-toxicologist-turned-med-writer) with Dr. Nichols as it gave me chance to reflect on my career choices and what I love about toxicology and medical writing.
