I recently spoke to attorneys at the Jenkins Law Library in Philadelphia about some principles of toxicology that can help them when reviewing cases related to drugs and alcohol. This is one of my favorite talks to give attorneys since it is a bread-and-butter toxicology lecture. Thank you to everyone who attended (including my friend and colleague, Jane Miloradovich, PharmD) and for some really great questions!
