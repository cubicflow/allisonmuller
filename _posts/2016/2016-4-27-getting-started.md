Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *

Take a look at this post inside the CloudCannon markdown editor to get a quick feel for it. If markdown initially seems too daunting, you can always use the Visual Editor instead.


## Emphasis.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_. Strong emphasis, aka bold, with double **asterisks** or __underscores__.


## Lists

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Another Item

* Unordered List Item
* More List Item
* Last One

## Links

Urls in angle brackets will get converted into links

<https://www.google.com>

You can also add linktext

[I'm an inline-style link with linktext](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


## Horizontal Rule

---

Three or more hyphens make a horizontal rule!

***

Three or more asterisks will work as well.


## Embed Images

If the image is smaller then the width of the content area the the image will be displayed at its native size.

If the image is larger then the content area it will scale to fit the availible space.

For the best quality to size ratio we recommend using images no larger then 900px on the largest side.

## Inline HTML

Markdown also lets us put plain HTML into our pages. This lets us do just about anything, but you'll probably be mainly using it for video embeds

## Headings

Different levels of headings are created by beginning a new line with a # sign. Smaller headings are generated by beginning the line with more # signs.

# One For H1

## Two Hashes For H2

### Three For Even Deeper Headings

#### And So On

##### All The Way To H5

&nbsp;

**The largest level of heading (H1) will generate a heading larger then the post title so it is generally recommended that you use H2 as your base heading**

## Additional Documentation

[The CloudCannon Documentation](https://docs.cloudcannon.com/) is a the best place to start if you have a question.
